# variables

- varaibles are named data storage
- variables are strongly typed in java which means when we declare a variable we have to specify the type of the variable
this means that the variable can only store values that compatible with the declared variable type.
- values can be modified

*********************************************

varaible naming conventions

- rule allows use of letters, numbers, $ and _ but by convention we only use numbers and letters
- first character is not a number, since by convention we do not use $ and _ in names therefore by convention it always starts with a letter
valid variable names e.g.

int total;
int grade4;

- follow a style often referred to as camel case this means that the first letter is lowercase, the start of each word after the first is uppercase, and all other letters are lower case
e.g.

int bankAccountBalance;
int level2Training;
